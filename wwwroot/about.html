                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>My name is Mike Jongbloet [top image] and I am about to graduate from a Multimedia Design and Technology course at the University of Kent. </p>
                    <p>I live by the seaside in Whitstable, Kent, UK and enjoy all thigns football, playing cards, my Xbox and take an interest in most sport.</p>
                    <p>I am primarily a web designer and developer, having about 4 years of commercial experience (2 years freelancing whilst at University, 2 years at a marketing agency), but have recently expanded my skills into Flash design, animation and programming as well.</p>
                    
                    <h2 style="margin-top: 20px">What is 'Paddy the Panda'?</h2>
                    <p>He is a Panda of course!</p>
                    <p>No 'Paddy the Panda: Kidnap Chaos' is the result of my final years work at University. As a final year project I chose to use the time to expand my skills and challenge myself by moving away from what I am comfortable with (HTML, CSS, PHP) and learning a tool which I had previously barely used - Flash.</p>
                    <p>Over the timescale of the project I have learnt to use the Flash interface, design in Flash, and how to code using an 'Object Orientated' style in Actionscript 3.</p> 
                    <p>I took inspiration from various other Flash games on the Internet, and came up with a storyline which would appeal to children and adults alike, as well as a "cute" main character to top it all off. I then had the daunting task of learning ActionScript 3 from scratch, out came the books and away went my life!</p>
                    <p>After a few months of learning and then putting into practise what I have learnt I have come away with a game I am extremely happy with.</p>
                    <p>The game is deliverable mainly across the internet but also on DVD-ROM. The images on the right show the other parts of the project which included design for a DVD cover, the CD itself, and a DVD inlay.</p>
